    "The first dataset is The WeRateDogs Twitter archive, i imported a csv file called 'twitter-archive-enhanced.csv'. I downloaded the  get tweet image predictions data provided in udacity classroom since i could twitter didn't grant me access to their API. The last dataset I gathered was additional data from Twitter API. I extracted the tweet_id, favorite_count and retweet_count from the third dataset."

    "\n",
    "#### Quality\n",
    "##### Enhanced Twitter Archive:\n",
    "1. Tweet_id column dtype is integer.\n",
    "2. Timestamp column dtype is not in datetime.\n",
    "3. There are 78 replies to be remoed from the dataset.\n",
    "4. There are 181 retweets to be removed from the dataset.\n",
    "5. Not every tweet has identified dog stages.\n",
    "6. Wrong ratings i.e. the numerator and denominator ratings were given in different columns\n",
    "7. Capitalize first letters in name column\n",
    "8. Identify rating_denominator which is less than 10 and change to 10\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Image Table\n",
    "1. Tweet_id column dtype is int.\n",
    "2. More than one predictions in for dogs in one single tweet.\n",
    "3. There are non-dog predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Twitter Extra Data\n",
    "1. Wrong id column name\n",
    "2. Count columns have object type instead of integer type.\n",
    "3. Wrong id dtype format, integer instead of string\n",
